# Web Scraping Project – Quotes Dataset

This project demonstrates how to perform basic **web scraping** using Python and BeautifulSoup.  
I scraped data from a public, beginner-friendly website — **Quotes to Scrape** — and created a custom dataset that can be used for analysis or further learning.
